# Ai Tools Hub for Developers

There are two types of developers: those who are afraid of Ai taking their jobs and those who either don’t care or are unaware of what’s happening! But instead of falling into either of these mindsets, why not focus on how you can maximize the benefits of Ai? Personally, I believe Ai will eventually take over many jobs, including ours. However, as developers, our role is to solve real-world problems—not just write code for the sake of it. So rather than fearing Ai, consider how you can leverage these tools to enhance your work today. And even if Ai does replace your job someday, you can still use it to build apps and tools that benefit others and generate more income. If used intelligently, Ai can open up opportunities far beyond the 9-to-5 job you’re worried about losing. Embrace it, and let it empower you to create and innovate in ways you never imagined.

## UI Screenshot to Code Tools

> Before listing the tools, here is a quick tip on how to take a full-page screenshot with Chrome DevTools:
> After opening DevTools, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) to open the Run command Menu. Then, in the Run command menu, start typing “screenshot” until you see the option "Capture full-size screenshot".Click "Capture full-size screenshot" from the list, and Chrome will automatically scroll through the entire page and capture a screenshot. The screenshot will be saved to your default Downloads folder.

- [Quick Screenshot to Code](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1393007160057387991/quick-screenshot-to-code): This a plugin for Figma. As described by his creator:
> Paste a small screenshot of any website you would like inside of a Figjam page. Open the Quick Screenshot to Code plugin. Select the screenshot and click "Convert". The process takes a few seconds, but the plugin will generate fully-functional HTML and CSS code into a code block on the screen.
 I have tested this plugin for a few screenshots and gave good results! It doesn't mimic the exact screenshot but it is a very good starting point; esepcially if you don't have any design skills, as it will help you cut your workflow down and speed up the process of building UIs with HTML. It also supports libraries like React or Angular.
